Atom Interview Code Review Guidance

This document provides guidance for the code review section of the technical interview.

The goal of the code review is to evaluate the candidate's ability to read and understand code, evaluate design decisions, spotting AntiPatterns, and to provide constructive focused feedback. So, what does this mean to you?

You will have about 30 minutes to tell us about the things that <b>you</b> think are significant (that's part of the assessment).

There are three sections: SQL, API, and Library. You can consider each to be a separate, they are all in the same solution purely to make this assessment.

API and Library are both .NET projects; SQL is a folder that contains a schema, query, and execution plan to comment.

You might find calls to interfaces that lead nowhere, you don't need to go down these rabbit holes, they are just there to make the code sample build.
